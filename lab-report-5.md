## Part 2

One of the cool things that I learned this quarter in the second half of CSE15L labs were the use of GitHub and its applications to many facets of programming. GitHub has been something that I knew about, but was intimidated by. Previously, just looking at the UI was sort of confusing at times, but the labs continued to use and reinforce my abilities of GitHub. This is also relevant to my ability to use the command line, as the labs better familiarized myself to the utilizations of such. GitHub, the command line, and many additional skills that I learned in this class were extremely interesting to see and test with, as this class provided the groundwork to further enhance these abilities that I am sure to make use of in future classes and beyond.
